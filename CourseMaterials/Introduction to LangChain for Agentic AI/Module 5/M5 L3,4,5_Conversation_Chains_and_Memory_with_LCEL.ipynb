Blue whales can reach lengths of up to 100 feet (30 meters) or more and can weigh as much as 200 tons (approximately 181 metric tonnes). These magnificent marine mammals are not only the largest animals alive today but are also believed to be the largest animals to have ever existed on Earth, surpassing even the largest dinosaurs. Their immense size is supported by their diet, which primarily consists of tiny shrimp-like animals called krill."
